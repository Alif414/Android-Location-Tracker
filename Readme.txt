Location tracker project which uses the GPS to find the latitude and longitude of your position every 10 seconds

It then uses volley to POST the method into a PHP function in my XAMPP server and the PHP function uses the two locations to calculate the distance travelled

The response is then sent back and set into the app.

NB: As there are 100s of files, only the code is given.
